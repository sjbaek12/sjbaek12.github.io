We do this through creative innovation product excellence though thoughtful design and always putting the needs and wellbeing of the patient first so our work will ultimately improve lives. We are bringing our first product to market a cervical retraction device that uses gentle suction to engage and manipulate the cervix for a variety of gynecological procedures. This device replaces a painful barbaric instrument called the cervical tenaculum which causes painful trauma to the cervix by piercing the tissue of the cervical stroma. Women should have the choice of a gentle atraumatic option when undergoing these myriad of intrauterine procedures. Currently entering clinical investigation is our second product an IUD insertion device that vastly simplifies the insertion procedure with the belief that any health care worker anywhere in the world should be able to insert an IUD with ease and safety. We have set out to accomplish just this with the belief that with the Bioceptive Inserter we can help enable women to take control of their family planning with the best available method. Our work on this device has been and continues to be supported by multiple grants from the Saving Lives at Birth consortium of the Gates Foundation USAID and others.\n",

We do this through creative innovation product excellence though thoughtful design and always putting the needs and wellbeing of the patient first so our work will ultimately improve lives. We are bringing our first product to market a cervical retraction device that uses gentle suction to engage and manipulate the cervix for a variety of gynecological procedures. This device replaces a painful barbaric instrument called the cervical tenaculum which causes painful trauma to the cervix by piercing the tissue of the cervical stroma. Women should have the choice of a gentle atraumatic option when undergoing these myriad of intrauterine procedures. Currently entering clinical investigation is our second product an IUD insertion device that vastly simplifies the insertion procedure with the belief that any health care worker anywhere in the world should be able to insert an IUD with ease and safety. We have set out to accomplish just this with the belief that with the Bioceptive Inserter we can help enable women to take control of their family planning with the best available method. Our work on this device has been and continues to be supported by multiple grants from the Saving Lives at Birth consortium of the Gates Foundation USAID and others.\r\n",

They have cut and dissected thousands of fish themselves to understand their anatomy and bone structure. In doing so They discovered a process for producing whole boneless Asian Carp fillets. They also manufacture a healthy environmentally friendly all natural chemical free form of surimi a type of paste made from fish protein and surimi based products. rn rn High quality surimi has 3 requirements it must 1) have a white color 2) not smell fishy and 3) have a certain type of springy chewiness when cooked. This is typically achieved by chemical additives and fillers which decrease nutritional value and add health risks. FIn Gourmet surimi has been tested by the independent third party lab NSF and has received an SA grading (second highest the top grade can only be achieved by Alaskan Pollack surimi).rn rn FIn Gourmet s surimi and surimi based products are in high demand but their approach to fulfilling this demand will be respectful of the Kentucky environment and the local communities. They have markets for several parts of the fish (heads skin carcass roe) and have partnerships with groups which create products from all components of the fish (guts carcass head skin etc.). They cannot waste a single component of this valuable resource and in fact have formed partnerships with Murray State University and the Kentucky Wildlife and Fisheries to participate in studying this fish its impact on the environment and the mitigation of over proliferation in regional waterways. They do this because it is here in Kentucky where the water is pristine that the wild caught Carps are of the best quality and where FIn Gourmet s products will be Kentucky Signature Products proudly made in the USA.\r\n",

Hapi was established in 2013 to bring education and sustainable health nutrition and fitness programs directly to the doorsteps of children and families living in multi family apartment communities.Our goal is to deliver good returns to investors while providing good value for our residents. We capitalize on low prices and low interest rates in cities where millions of people need comfortable safe healthy places to live that they can afford. When we invest in these neglected rental properties we add value through many improvements which have a direct and positive impact on families and communities. At the heart of our effort lies a desire to create a more peaceful and enjoyable quality of life for our residents and surrounding communities.New equity crowdfunding laws that came about through the JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) Act now allow private companies the ability to raise capital online from the general public. That means that everyone and anyone regardless of age income level or wealth can now engage in private market investing and invest directly into and alongside real estate experts like us. Impact Housing is one of a handful of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) to take advantage of this new avenue of capital raising thus far and the first and only that plans to deliver good homes to residents and both financial and social returns to investors.\r\n",

We establish market access to eyeglasses and vision correction for people living in poverty so that they may enhance their livelihoods learning and quality of life. To date VisionSpring has sold nearly three million pairs of glasses to low income consumers living in emerging and frontier markets and is working to reach 10 million pairs by the symbolic year 2020.As a social enterprise social change motivates us first. Our focus on sales and revenue targets serves and advances our mission objective to correct refractive error with eyeglasses so that low income consumers may experience improved functioning productivity and income earning potential on a sustained basis. We are working to transform the systemic dysfunction of the optical market which has failed to deliver a 700 year old technology to 644 million consumers who earn less than $4 a day. We serve low income consumers not as beneficiaries but as customers. Our customers expect a high quality affordable product and are willing to spend limited discretionary income for the immediate and tangible benefits of vision correction. Organizationally we are a hybrid. We are a registered 501(c)3 non profit and a Private Limited Company (PLC). We earn revenue and supplement it with contributed income. We hire change makers and pay bonuses and commissions. We run our business on both sales metrics and social impact measures. We exploit a range of organizational forms and practices to get the job done.\r\n",

To date VisionSpring has sold nearly three million pairs of glasses to low income consumers living in emerging and frontier markets and is working to reach 10 million pairs by the symbolic year 2020.As a social enterprise social change motivates us first. Our focus on sales and revenue targets serves and advances our mission objective to correct refractive error with eyeglasses so that low income consumers may experience improved functioning productivity and income earning potential on a sustained basis. We are working to transform the systemic dysfunction of the optical market which has failed to deliver a 700 year old technology to 644 million consumers who earn less than $4 a day. We serve low income consumers not as beneficiaries but as customers. Our customers expect a high quality affordable product and are willing to spend limited discretionary income for the immediate and tangible benefits of vision correction. Organizationally we are a hybrid. We are a registered 501(c)3 non profit and a Private Limited Company (PLC). We earn revenue and supplement it with contributed income. We hire change makers and pay bonuses and commissions. We run our business on both sales metrics and social impact measures. We exploit a range of organizational forms and practices to get the job done.\\r\\n'},\n",
